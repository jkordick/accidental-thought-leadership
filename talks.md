### [Use GitHub Copilot in Your Favorite Java IDEs](https://jdconf.com/2025/agenda.html#emea-session-02)

- Abstract: In this session, we’ll explore how GitHub Copilot’s latest features can revolutionize your development workflow across IntelliJ, VS Code, and Eclipse. Learn how agent mode enables Copilot to not only generate code but also iteratively refine and execute multi-file changes with next-edit suggestions and autonomous error handling. We’ll demonstrate how storing tailored prompt files directly in your editor and leveraging enterprise-grade compliance controls can accelerate your move from idea to production code.

## 2025-06-24 | [AgentCon 2025 - Berlin](https://globalai.community/chapters/berlin/events/agentcon-2025-berlin/)
### Boost your coding productivity with GitHub Copilot Agent
- Abstract: This year, Github introduced the agent mode for GitHub Copilot in Visual Studio Code, announcing the general availability of Copilot Edits, and providing a first look at our SWE agent. In this talk, we will demonstrate the difference between the three modes and show the advantages to use the agent mode. In agent mode, Copilot will iterate on not just its own output, but the result of that output. And it will iterate until it has completed all the subtasks required to complete your prompt. Instead of performing just the task you requested, Copilot now has the ability to infer additional tasks that were not specified but are also necessary for the primary request to work.

## 2025-07-10 | [WeAreDevelopers World Congress 2025](https://www.wearedevelopers.com/world-congress)
### Migrating from COBOL with AI: A Moonshot Demo
- Abstract: COBOL still underpins many mission-critical systems—but traditional modernization approaches often come with high risk, cost, and complexity. In this session, we’ll explore how AI-assisted development tools like GitHub Copilot and autonomous agent frameworks are making large-scale legacy migration not only feasible, but strategically viable. Through a live demo of a simplified COBOL migration, I’ll show how AI can accelerate key activities: reverse engineering business logic, generating documentation, creating tests, and transforming legacy code into modern architectures. We’ll also examine real-world customer projects, highlighting how to reduce time-to-value, mitigate migration risks, and integrate AI responsibly into existing development workflows. Whether you’re evaluating modernization initiatives or looking to align AI adoption with long-term architecture goals, this session offers practical insights for both technical leaders and hands-on developers.

## 2025-10-16 | [Dev & Donuts](https://yasoon.de/dev-donuts/)
### Deployment & Architektur: Automatisieren oder Stabilisieren? - Das Release ist fertig – und jetzt?
- Abstract: In dieser Session schauen uns wir genau diesen Moment an und machen daraus eine Deployment-Story – ganz ohne Copy-Paste von IaC und ohne fragwürdige Bash-Skripte. Stattdessen: ein GitHub-Repo, KI-unterstützte IaC-Generierung und ein Workflow, der die App sauber nach Azure deployed – da, wo sie hingehört. Ich zeige live, wie wir KI-Tools und GitHub Actions nutzen, um eine automatisierte Deployment-Pipeline aufzubauen – mit Platform Engineering und Developer Self-Services. Kein Plattform-Team? Macht nichts. Auch kleine Teams oder Solo-Devs können so wiederverwendbare, skalierbare Dev-Services aufbauen.

### Application Modernization with GitHub Copilot
- Abstract: Modernizing applications is less about rewriting and more about understanding, refactoring, and changing code safely.
In this talk we will show how GitHub Copilot supports real-world modernization workflows, from legacy code comprehension and refactoring to test generation and deployment. We focus on what works today, where human judgment is still required, and how GitHub Copilot fits into responsible engineering practices.

### [Wie baue ich intelligente Apps mit Azure OpenAI](https://www.infodays.de/genai-bonn/programm/konferenzprogramm/wie-baue-ich-intelligente-apps-mit-azure-openai)
- Abstract: In diesem Talk gehen wir direkt in die Praxis: Welche Möglichkeiten habe ich auf der Azure-Plattform, wenn ich sogenannte “intelligente Applikationen” entwickeln möchte? Welche Modelle kann ich für meine Zwecke nutzen, wann ist eine Eigenentwicklung sinnvoll und wann sind bereits existierende Copiloten die bessere Wahl. Zudem beleuchten wir, wie man Sicherheit und Compliance im Griff behält.

### Software Engineering in the Era of AI: A Reality Check
- Abstract: Agentic AI is reshaping how we build software, but we are far from the fully autonomous developer utopias that keynote slides love to promise. This talk takes a reality check on where we actually are. We will look at how AI in coding has moved from simple completions to true agentic workflows that can read, reason, refactor, and collaborate with humans.
 
From there, we trace the evolution from DevOps to Platform Engineering and now to Agentic DevOps, where automated systems take over the repetitive, high-context operational work that has slowed teams down for years. The talk highlights what is real today, what still breaks in production, and what guardrails strong engineering cultures must keep in place.
 
Finally, we open the window to what might come next. Not hype. Not science fiction. Just a grounded vision of agentic systems that understand architecture, navigate complexity, and help organizations move from reactive firefighting to proactive, AI-supported engineering.
