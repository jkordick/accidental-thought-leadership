### Migrating from COBOL with GitHub Copilot: a moonshot demo

- Abstract: In this session I'll use a simplified example of COBOL - one of the oldest programming languages still in use - to finally put to rest the age-old question: can you modernize your legacy systems? Answer: with GitHub Copilot, you (finally) can.

We'll take a look at different activities - from understanding legacy code to generating new documentation - that come up in real-world migration projects and how GitHub Copilot can help with each one.

Whether you're a seasoned COBOL dev or you're hearing about it for the first time right now come join me in this session to see how the past can (finally) meet the future with the help of AI.

## 2025-04-10 | [JDConf 2025](https://jdconf.com/2025/index.html#emea)
### [Use GitHub Copilot in Your Favorite Java IDEs](https://jdconf.com/2025/agenda.html#emea-session-02)

- Abstract: In this session, we’ll explore how GitHub Copilot’s latest features can revolutionize your development workflow across IntelliJ, VS Code, and Eclipse. Learn how agent mode enables Copilot to not only generate code but also iteratively refine and execute multi-file changes with next-edit suggestions and autonomous error handling. We’ll demonstrate how storing tailored prompt files directly in your editor and leveraging enterprise-grade compliance controls can accelerate your move from idea to production code.

Join Brian Benz — a Java Champion and Cloud Advocate at Microsoft — and Julia Kordick, Microsoft’s Global Black Belt for Developer Productivity, as they share insights, real-world examples, and best practices designed to boost productivity and streamline your daily coding tasks.

## 2025-06-24 | [AgentCon 2025 - Berlin](https://globalai.community/chapters/berlin/events/agentcon-2025-berlin/)
### Boost your coding productivity with GitHub Copilot Agent
- Abstract: This year, Github introduced the agent mode for GitHub Copilot in Visual Studio Code, announcing the general availability of Copilot Edits, and providing a first look at our SWE agent. In this talk, we will demonstrate the difference between the three modes and show the advantages to use the agent mode. In agent mode, Copilot will iterate on not just its own output, but the result of that output. And it will iterate until it has completed all the subtasks required to complete your prompt. Instead of performing just the task you requested, Copilot now has the ability to infer additional tasks that were not specified but are also necessary for the primary request to work.

## 2025-07-10 | [WeAreDevelopers World Congress 2025](https://www.wearedevelopers.com/world-congress)
### Migrating from COBOL with AI: A Moonshot Demo
- Abstract: COBOL still underpins many mission-critical systems—but traditional modernization approaches often come with high risk, cost, and complexity. In this session, we’ll explore how AI-assisted development tools like GitHub Copilot and autonomous agent frameworks are making large-scale legacy migration not only feasible, but strategically viable. Through a live demo of a simplified COBOL migration, I’ll show how AI can accelerate key activities: reverse engineering business logic, generating documentation, creating tests, and transforming legacy code into modern architectures. We’ll also examine real-world customer projects, highlighting how to reduce time-to-value, mitigate migration risks, and integrate AI responsibly into existing development workflows. Whether you’re evaluating modernization initiatives or looking to align AI adoption with long-term architecture goals, this session offers practical insights for both technical leaders and hands-on developers.

## 2025-10-16 | [Dev & Donuts](https://yasoon.de/dev-donuts/)
### Deployment & Architektur: Automatisieren oder Stabilisieren? - Das Release ist fertig – und jetzt?
- Abstract: In dieser Session schauen uns wir genau diesen Moment an und machen daraus eine Deployment-Story – ganz ohne Copy-Paste von IaC und ohne fragwürdige Bash-Skripte. Stattdessen: ein GitHub-Repo, KI-unterstützte IaC-Generierung und ein Workflow, der die App sauber nach Azure deployed – da, wo sie hingehört. Ich zeige live, wie wir KI-Tools und GitHub Actions nutzen, um eine automatisierte Deployment-Pipeline aufzubauen – mit Platform Engineering und Developer Self-Services. Kein Plattform-Team? Macht nichts. Auch kleine Teams oder Solo-Devs können so wiederverwendbare, skalierbare Dev-Services aufbauen.

## 2025-12-16 | [GitHub Universe Recap 2025](https://github.com/resources/events/universe-recap-tour-emea)
### Application Modernization with GitHub Copilot
- Abstract: Modernizing applications is less about rewriting and more about understanding, refactoring, and changing code safely.
In this talk we will show how GitHub Copilot supports real-world modernization workflows, from legacy code comprehension and refactoring to test generation and deployment. We focus on what works today, where human judgment is still required, and how GitHub Copilot fits into responsible engineering practices.
