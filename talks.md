### Migrating from COBOL with GitHub Copilot: a moonshot demo

- Abstract: In this session I'll use a simplified example of COBOL - one of the oldest programming languages still in use - to finally put to rest the age-old question: can you modernize your legacy systems? Answer: with GitHub Copilot, you (finally) can.

We'll take a look at different activities - from understanding legacy code to generating new documentation - that come up in real-world migration projects and how GitHub Copilot can help with each one.

Whether you're a seasoned COBOL dev or you're hearing about it for the first time right now come join me in this session to see how the past can (finally) meet the future with the help of AI.
