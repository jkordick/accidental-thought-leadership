- Name: Julia Kordick

- Bio: Julia is a Software Global Black Belt at Microsoft, helping large-scale organizations accelerate dev workflows through pragmatic, end-to-end platform engineering. With a background as a Software Engineer, Dev Lead, and Cloud Solution Architect, she speaks fluent developer and management—and knows how to bridge the gap without losing either side in translation.

She’s a big-picture thinker who also loves to understand the details. Web and frontend will always have a place in her ❤️.

Outside work, Julia is a gamer, a proud fahrradmaus, and a former quarterback for a women’s American football team (yes, really).

On Wednesdays, she smashes the patriarchy.
